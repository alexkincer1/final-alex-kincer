In this course, we were given prompts to compare and contrast contemporary beliefs with Ancient and Medieval beliefs on particular topcs. The reason behind these papers were to encourage us to think deeply about our beliefs vs. the things we were reading so all ideas could be explored for deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
