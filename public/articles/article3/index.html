        <h2 id="what-ai-did-i-use">What AI did I use?</h2>
<p>When searching for assistance, the AI tool I used was ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="when-did-i-use-it">When Did I use it?</h2>
<p>For majority of the edits I made to my website, I was able to pull up Dr. White&rsquo;s file and copy them over. However, when it came to making enhancing adjustments, I looked to AI. You can read more in-depth about these enhancements in <a href="/articles/Article4">my Website Enhancement Article here</a>.</p>
<p>In regards to my overall usage of AI, I found it very useful when I had specific needs that I knew needed to be met. When I was able to give ChatGPT very specific instructions with great detail, it was easy and clear steps to achieve my wants. I found it most helpful when I had code, like ones available from Dr. White&rsquo;s repository, that I knew needed to be altered or added to and I just needed guidance on what pieces I was missing. However, the main usage of ChatGPT did occur when I was making the enhancement to add the side navigating bar to my blogs and articles. This idea rooted from my classmate Tyler&rsquo;s navigation bar that he presented in class on December 4th, 2025. When hearing how difficult of a time he had and using my understanding that our processes would be different due to different wants and themes being used, I knew I could create my own form of this bar without going through such tedious actions like he described. So, I headed to ChatGPT and had this <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69326476-fed0-8002-98fe-def00be2bab4">conversation</a>.</p>
<p>This conversation kick-started my enhancements that, again, will be talked about in another article.</p>
<p>I found AI to be most helpful in this situation because of the clarity it gave me to build off of when doing things like changing the side bar to the right side of the website, changing the colors, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-flaws">The Flaws</h2>
<p>As stated before, I feel AI is hard to use when you are unsure of what you are asking for or needing edits to be made because AI can never be fully aware of all the details imbedded in your problems or ideas if you do not express them in a way the computer will comprehend. In the beginning of this website process, I could not have a successful interaction with AI because I wasn&rsquo;t fully sure of what I was wanting to accomplish myself. I feel the fall of AI comes when the user isn&rsquo;t understanding the fact that they really are talking to a computer.</p>
<h2 id="misconception">Misconception</h2>
<p>When first making my enhancement, I did not enjoy how it switched my list of articles and blogs into a verticle list that was all one page. Before the enhancement, my posts were in little squares that all had &ldquo;read more&rdquo; boxes to see the full posts. Once this occurred, I asked AI to help and it was very unhelpful and wasted a lot of time. I do not have the link to this conversation, but I completely deleted my actions and had to backtrack for quite sometime. I continued to repeat the same question on how to achieve a new look to the listing of my posts, but was unable to find a solution and just let them how they are.</p>
