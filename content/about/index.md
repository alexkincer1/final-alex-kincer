## My Education Background

I am a current senior at Georgetown College that will graduate in May 2026. I attended high school at Letcher County Central High School in Whitesburg, KY where I graduated in 2022. I am majoring in Health Science with a minor in Computer Science. 

## Outside of the Classroom

Other than being a student, I am also an athlete on Georgetown's campus. I attend GC on a cheerleading scholarship to be on the sideline team and UCA Gameday competitive team. Outside of GC, I am a volunteer teacher at Grace Christian Church in Georgetown where I teach ages 6 weeks to 5 years old during Sunday services. I am deeply rooted in my faith and enjoy working with children in this setting. 

## Future Plans

I have officially been accepted and enrolled in Milligan University's Master of Occupational Therapy program in Johnson City, TN and will begin in the Fall of 2026 after graduating from GC in May. With this program, I intend to become a Pediatric Occupational Therapist. 

## My Family

I am the youngest-ish of FIVE girls where I have a twin sister and three older sisters. My sisters and I have all attended NAIA colleges in the Mid-South Conference while on athletic scholarships for a variety of sports. My parents are both from Letcher County, KY and attended college at Morehead State University where my dad obtained an IT degree and my mother a degree in Social Work. My dad works for Appalachain Regional Healthcare and my mother is a Social Worker for the state of Kentucky. My sisters work in a variety of jobs including Marketing, Nursing, Psychology, and restaurant management. My family have played large roles in my educational, athletics, and life outside of school.
