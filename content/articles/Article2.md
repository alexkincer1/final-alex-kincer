## Class Summary

KHS 347 or Culture and Diversity in Healthcare is a course given at Georgetown College in the Fall semesters and taught by Dr. Megan Tackett-Trella. This course is about exploring different cultures and backgrounds to become more open-minded individuals in the healthcare field. 

## Assignment Prompt

For this assignment you will need to include a personal reflection that pertains to the docuseries [Ballin' Out](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhS6jLPSLou2E9PIhWcF2XRLlpFz-ycn&si=Hamzz2bn-q9LgVcGLinks). 

All 5 episodes (each are ~10 min long) should be watched so a reflection can be made.

For your reflection you should explain your personal view on the experiences that the athletes face. Do not simply explain what happened in the docuseries but instead tie it to your own cultural viewpoints (comparing and contrasting what was presented in the series). The reflection should be a minimum of 500 words and AI sources should not be utilized. Doing so will result in a 0% on the assignment.

## My Reflection

Regarding the first episode on LGBTQ+ athletes for wheelchair basketball, I did enjoy getting to see this from the inside as I have always wondered about sports performed within wheelchairs, and it is very interesting to learn about. There are so many rules and differences in running basketball and wheelchair basketball and it is eye opening. The most relatable portion of this episode for me would be the effects that coaches make on teams, athletes, and experiences. Though I have never had a situation of needing to “come out” or be scared to show my (straight) sexuality, the effects coaches and teammates have had on my comfortability and feeling of safety when expressing my feelings and thoughts are important and experienced in each practice and encounter, I have with them. 
In the fourth episode, I assumed I would relate to the episode because of the “mental health” title. I related to the negative mindset discussed when a mistake is made in the game in an athletic and unathletic aspect. In addition, having a coach that is draining both mentally and physically can be career-ending and life altering for an athlete. However, seeing the athletes take the steps to fight back and persevere against the lash back that the community was giving to the athletes for going against a public figure like Trooper Johnson was inspiring. There have been many times in my own athlete career where instances would happen that made myself or teammates uncomfortable, unheard, or pushed to the side in many ways. Like the episode, a coach like pushes and pushes the team to absolute exhaustion to make them feel like they are close to injury or giving up, but we didn’t feel open or supported enough to complain or step in, we just continued to fail and eventually get a break. 
Finally, also like the fourth episode, the class/session where the psychologist had team bonding questions and activities like the sticky notes and opening up about what is being studied and looked at, that is so appreciated and overlooked in sports. Over the last four years at Georgetown, when we near the end of the season and everyone is tired of each other or having a bad environment, Coach Joanie always brings us colored construction paper and markers and has us sit in a circle to write our names in the middle of our papers. Once we have our names, we pass the papers around the circle for each person on the team to write something they appreciate about the person on the paper or something they’ve seen them improve on throughout this season. I appreciated this until last season she gave the option to skip over someone’s paper if you didn’t have anything nice to say. I feel like this was defeating the purpose of this activity and put a damper on the team. Though names are never put on responses, it would be easy to tell who skipped and who didn’t. This could’ve been a breaking point for mentally exhausted people that really needed to be lifted up.
In conclusion, sports, coaches, and teammates can make or break an experience, but using healthy methods of coping and understanding your feelings while also standing up for yourself and others is important to success and continuing on in life.
