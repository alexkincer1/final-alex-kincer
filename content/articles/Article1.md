## Introduction

Institutional Racism refers to ways in which institutions like school systems, housing authorities, healthcare, etc. maintain racial inequities through practices and procedures that they’ve decided are norms. Two examples or institutional racism includes the education funding in school segregations and healthcare disparities. 

## Supporting Information

First, education funding comes from local property taxes, so in areas where it is predominantly non-white neighborhoods often receive much lower funding, much fewer resources, and less experienced teachers because it is all that the areas can afford. This pattern leads to educational achievement gaps because of race. This institutional racism is based on the disproportional disadvantaged of racialized group. For example, “low-poverty districts that are primarily White spend almost $2,000 more per student than low-poverty districts where most students are people of color.” (Carter, 2025). 
A second way of practiced Institutional Racism is healthcare disparities where predominantly non-White communities have fewer high-quality facilities, lesser access to care, and worse outcomes. Even when physicians are not individually biased, the institution’s practices and norms can systematically produce worse outcomes for certain racialized groups. For example, institutional racism in academic health centers occur in how policies and practices disadvantaged non-White (Adkins-Jackson, 2021).
Next, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva’s four themes of color-blind perspective includes Abstract liberalism, Cultural Racism, Naturalization, and Minimization of Racism. The phrase “I do not see color” generally means that you treat everyone equally. This explains that they do not judge the character of a person by skin color or discriminate. This can lead to discriminating thoughts because of seeing color as the ideology rather than an actual practice of treating everyone equally.
