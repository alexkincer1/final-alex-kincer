## PHI201 - Spring 2025

#### Idea for this Writing

In Spring of 2025, I was enrolled in PHI 201, History of Philosophy, at Georgetown College. In this course, we were given prompts to compare and contrast contemporary beliefs with Ancient and Medieval beliefs on particular topcs. The reason behind these papers were to encourage us to think deeply about our beliefs vs. the things we were reading so all ideas could be explored for deeper understanding. 

#### Writing Prompt

Compare and contrast the Medieval and Modern worldviews, focusing on their understandings of God, human purpose, and the nature of reality.

#### My Response

A main difference in the Modern and Medieval worldview is the ideas and opinions people have created on God and the world He created. The contrasts in ideas are rooted in authority, human purpose, and the nature and expectations of the divine. The Medieval worldview looks out on to the world through a divine lens that creates life and everything in it to be centered around God. However, the Modern worldview is more human-centered as it prioritizes science and secular ideas that leave God behind. These differing views reflect the changes that have occurred in the fundamentals of how things are perceived and experienced as the Modern worldview favors human reasoning rather than a God natured reality. 
With a Medieval worldview, God is viewed as omnipotent and omniscient as He is involved in every aspect of one’s life. Through the God-centered lens, He is looked to for order, truth, and life of each human. As humans continue to look in Him, it is believed that in order to fulfill a purposeful life, one must use their existence to glorify and serve Him to get as close to Him as possible due to the need for being united with God through salvation and suffering that is endured in everyday life. This is expressed in Anselm Proslogion as he uses the lack of God in his life to be described as “bitter” and in a state of “hunger” to be fed by God’s ways of “renew(ing) and refashion(ing)” as he could be “sweeten(ed)” through devotion to Him (Proslogion, Pg 6). In this aim to fulfill a Godly life, it is essential to understand that sin is real, and God is the only way to be saved from a life that has “been stiffened, dulled, and obstructed by the long-standing weakness of sin” (Proslogion, Pg. 17). 
However, in the scientific Modern worldview, there are many options as to how to feel about God. One can be deeply connected, distant, or reject Him all together if their life doesn’t emphasize a role of God being direct or large enough to focus on. Due to the drastic evolutions made in technology and sciences, human reason and their use of these tools dominate over past views, and create their own ideas based on evidence and independent experiences. With this new way of thinking, the purpose of one’s life is now self-created as the only fulfillment being idolized in self-fulfillment in autonomy and success in the greedy world. For example, suffering that was once seen as perseverance and a way to use God is now interpreted through feelings and modern ways of elimination rather than thought through theologically or philosophically. Due to an individual prioritizing their own beliefs, ethics and morals that have been molded or reshaped begin to fall into a secular category rather than a spiritual one as the goal is to be successful in their own minds, not in God’s. 
In conclusion, Medieval worldview embraces a God-centered reality that focused on purpose, spirituality, and order but is shifted with Modern worldview to create a human-centered world that uses personal success, scientific revelations, and individual belief of reason to reshape the moral and philosophical foundations of human nature. As a result, God’s role in one’s life has changed from a once all powerful and completely in control force to a symbol of presence in a world that only calls upon him in times of trouble and despair that is experienced through secular actions and ideas. Because of this shift and the evolution that continues to push forward, suffering and navigation of suffering has been redefined as people are torn between using their daily lives and beliefs to serve God and wondering whether or not God can really be in control or not.
